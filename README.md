This project is aimed to build a PCA-RNN model to predict the winner of The National Basketball Association’s (NBA) the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for 2017-18 regular season. Using both NBA players individual statistics and MVP voting history from 2000-01 to 2016-17 season, we will develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) model in order to estimate who can receive the highest MVP votes in 2017-18 season. All the datasets will firstly be scaled using principal component analysis (PCA). The results show that PCA can significantly ascertain appropriate input parameters for our RNN model and the RNN model is a cogent predicator of NBA’s MVP.
